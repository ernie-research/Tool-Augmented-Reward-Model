However, while the answer is not entirely accurate, the discrepancy isn't that large. The visibility reported by the assistant (6.6 km) and the response (7.0 km) are relatively close, and such small differences might occur due to different sources or measurement techniques. The presence of a notable discrepancy points to the fact that the given response is not correct.", "score": "-1.0"}}}
