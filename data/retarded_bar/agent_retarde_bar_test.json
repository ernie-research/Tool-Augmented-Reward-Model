{"id": "retarded_bar_0", "question": "Rockets will eventually go to space, so why not launch from there?", "pos_answer": {"answer": "Generally speaking, before launch, rockets are vertically placed on launch pads rather than in the sky. That's because the lift generated by air buoyancy can't support their weight. However, for very small and light rockets, it's possible to transport them to the sky beforehand using balloons or planes for launch. This technology is still under research.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Gravity on Earth is stronger, so launching from the surface provides more initial thrust for rockets.", "score": -1}}

{"id": "retarded_bar_2", "question": "Since gravity is always present, can't I achieve perpetual motion by harnessing gravity to do work?", "pos_answer": {"answer": "This humorous question stems from a misunderstanding that many people have about gravity. In reality, it's incorrect to assume that gravity can provide infinite energy simply because it doesn't require fuel like fossil fuels. Utilizing gravity to do work, in simple terms, involves objects being positioned at a higher point and falling to a lower point. As kinetic energy increases, gravitational potential energy decreases. Therefore, it's not an unlimited source of energy.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Of course! Just attach a string to a spinning top and let gravity pull it forever, creating endless energy!", "score": -1}}

It wasn't a tattoo in the usual sense associated with negative connotations.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Because his tattoo was actually a secret map of the enemy's hideout, so they had to let him in the military to use his tattoo skills!", "score": -1}}
{"id": "retarded_bar_5", "question": "Why do talent shows like \"The Voice\" never have mute contestants? Is this discrimination against people with disabilities?", "pos_answer": {"answer": "In fact, talent shows like \"The Voice\" are not discriminating against mute individuals or others with disabilities; rather, it's due to the nature and requirements of the competition. Shows like \"The Voice\" require participants to be able to sing, and individuals who are mute due to issues with their throat and vocal cords cannot produce sound, making it impossible to meet this requirement. Of course, the format of talent shows also has its limitations and cannot encompass the talents and abilities of everyone. We should respect the differences in each person, including those with disabilities, and provide them with equal opportunities and resources to enable them to showcase their talents and abilities.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "It's because they're afraid the mute contestants would communicate their talent telepathically, giving them an unfair advantage!", "score": -1}}

{"id": "retarded_bar_9", "question": "Does discriminating against males count as discrimination against females?", "pos_answer": {"answer": "Discriminating solely against males is not equivalent to discriminating against females. Discrimination refers to the unjust treatment or denial of rights and opportunities to a particular group, rather than imposing specific limitations or penalties solely on one group. Therefore, if discrimination targets only males, it is not discrimination against females, as females are not experiencing the same unjust treatment. Discrimination should be seen as a universal issue where any group can potentially be its victim.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Yes, because discrimination based on gender negatively impacts both males and females.", "score": -1}}

Why is it that washing apples with water, which cannot be consumed directly, allows them to be eaten directly?", "pos_answer": {"answer": "Although water is not suitable for direct consumption, using it to wash fruits can help remove surface dust, bacteria, and impurities, making the fruits cleaner and more hygienic. Additionally, the outer skin of apples serves as a protective barrier, preventing water from entering the flesh. Therefore, even after being washed with water, apples can retain their original taste and nutritional value. Of course, when consuming fruits, we should also pay attention to their hygiene and storage to ensure they do not affect our health.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Water used for washing is different from drinking water.

While guide dogs are highly intelligent and well-trained, they are still animals and cannot understand and follow regulations like humans. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety and cleanliness of public spaces, it's necessary to restrict guide dogs from entering certain places. Of course, we should also strive to provide better services and assistance to blind individuals, allowing them to more conveniently integrate into society.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "It's for the guide dogs to have a chance to experience a sightseeing adventure of their own!", "score": -1}}

However, the surface of a non-stick pan is usually coated with a special non-stick technology, making it resistant to sticking and not easily adhered to. Therefore, even if you were to use super glue, it would be very difficult to stick it to a non-stick pan. Of course, I do not recommend attempting to use super glue on a non-stick pan, as this could damage the pan's coating, affecting its lifespan and safety for cooking.", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Yes, super glue can stick to a non-stick pan, but it won't bond well due to the pan's non-stick surface.", "score": -1}}

Similarly, in high-temperature environments above 50\u00b0C, the lubricating oil of firearms could fail, leading to increased friction in mechanical components and potentially affecting the accuracy and reliability of the firearm. Therefore, as long as the fridge temperature isn't lower than -40 degrees, a Gatling gun can still be considered a firearm (hot weapon).", "score": 1}, "neg_answer": {"answer": "Yes, taking a Gatling gun out of the fridge is considered a cold weapon because it was chilling in there!", "score": -1}}

In the instant lightning occurs, charges pass through ions in the air to create a current. This current is a transient, high-voltage, high-frequency current that can be seen as a form of complex alternating current.
