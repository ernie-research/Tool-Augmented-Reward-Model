One way that prime numbers can be used in computer security is to generate two prime numbers and then multiply them together to get a bigger number. The public key will be the result of multiplying the two prime numbers together. Because this huge number can only be broken down into its prime factors, in order to be able to decrypt messages, you need to be able to split this massive number into its two prime factors.  One of the most widely used applications of prime numbers in computing is the RSA encryption system, which was developed in 1978. The RSA system allows for the secure transmission of information, such as credit card numbers.  The RSA system requires two large prime numbers, and the larger the numbers, the safer the encryption.  Prime numbers are the building blocks of all natural numbers, so they are extremely useful in this context. ", "score": 0.5, "actions": "Thought: Do I need to use a tool?

The computers that manage modern engines are able to adjust the ignition system to accommodate lower-octane gasoline, but using regular gas instead of premium can still slightly decrease fuel economy and acceleration.

Because of problems with the heaters, the shuttle's fuel could freeze in the chilly environment of space, creating buildups of frozen fuel.  This could cause problems during atmospheric reentry, as thawing chunks of hydrazine could trigger leaks of combustable fuel.   The trouble was caused by failed heaters in one of the shuttle's auxiliary power units (APUs), which provide hydraulic power for the craft's engine nozzles, landing gear, and other moving parts used in flight.  The shuttle does have two other APUs, and if one had failed after launch, \"it would not have been a bad day,\" Moses said. Flight engineers have contingency plans in place to safely shut off a malfunctioning APU.

The original dog evolved from a common ancestor as the wolf, so no dogs descended from wolves.  Wolves evolved into dogs via genetic mutations and evolution, and humans played a role in selective breeding of dogs to produce various dog breeds, including Chihuahuas.  As part of the Canis lupus familiarias grouping, it's hard to pinpoint just what a dog really is, but today, all we know is that the happy, fluffy, friendly dogs that we call our companions and best friends tend to be something completely different from the wolves that they have evolved from generations ago.  The way that most species evolve over generations is through mutations in offspring that prove to be advantageous in its current environment. This mutation either helps the animal survive or makes it less likely to.  In the case of wolves becoming dogs, it started out with a small genetic mutation, making some wolves less prone to running away from a human (or anything it perceives as a threat) at a closer distance.

Instead, the lizards rely on structural changes that affect how light reflects off their skin, the researchers said.

Since chameleons can't generate their own body heat, changing the color of their skin is a way to maintain a favorable body temperature.

As you reduce the gas volume, the space where the gas molecules are must also be reduced, therefore, the same number of molecules in now a smaller space become compact or denser . The relationship is the same as before . You reduce the volume (space) by pressure, which reduced the air volume you have to breath . But now the space is smaller for the same number of molecules making them more dense . The volume of air in your tank does not change as you descend but when you exhale from your regulator at depth the air is then exposed to pressure and as the air travels to the surface it will be exposed to less and less pressure so your bubbles increase in size all the way to the surface .
